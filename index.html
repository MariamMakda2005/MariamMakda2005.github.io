  <p>Choose and order your favorite kind of artwork on my website. There is a veriety of choices, from acrylic, to watercolor to abstract art. You can even pick a Glass object and customize it however you like.
    <p/>

  <h2 class="subheadings">Problem</h2>
<p>People usually buy art made on canvases that is made by computers or expert artists, and there are very few of those.
  <p/>
</body>
<h2 class="subheadings">Solution</h2>
<p>Since there are not many people who handcraft artworks or paintings, I think that my business, will be helpful to many local people and neighbors too, because they can buy differnt kinds of creative peices of arts whenever and however they like it.
  <p/>

<h2 class="subheadings">Business Model</h2>
<p> My business is all about art. All kinds of arts. for example, there is Glass art, canvas art, and abstrtact art too. What I think will make my business a successful one is the fact that there is so much variety of things to choose from. The rates are very reasonable too. If customers go to regualr stores, they would probably find the prices higher than what my prices would be.
